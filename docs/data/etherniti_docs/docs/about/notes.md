# Releate notes

Etherniti allows companies, developers and startups to interact with Ethereum in a very easy and friendly way. We add an abstraction layer that allows a fast, reliable and secure interaction with Ethereum networks and their smart contracts. We provide a fully featured High Performance REST API to operate ethereum as its usually done with other tools such as Web3js, Metamask, etc.

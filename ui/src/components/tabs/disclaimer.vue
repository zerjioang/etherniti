			We are not responsible for any loss: <b>Ethereum</b>, {{app}} and some of the underlying script libraries (web3js, etc) and software (go-ethereum, etc) we use are under active development. We have tested {{app}} successfully, however there is always the chance of something going wrong and unexpected events can occur, and might lead to ETH lost. We do not recommend the usage of {{app}} for crypto operations (hardware based security is always better, aka, cold wallets). But if you want to use it, feel free to do it so, but rebember the facts that online website can be compromised, accounts stolen by fake sites, system hacked by cybercriminals, etc. In short, please do not transfer more than what you are willing to lose, and please be careful. If something happens, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for the lost Ether.
